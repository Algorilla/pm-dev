Current issues:
===============
Are length and deadline needed?
Shouldn't the length be determined by time elapsed from the earliest activity until the termination of the latests?

Exception handling:
Currently, most of the exception handling in PModel's MainController done via "catch (Exception ex).
The execption is handled by displaying a pop-up, making autamation of JUnit tests tedious because tester must click on every pop-up.
One specific place where this is a problem is with MainController.Login.
Other methods throw and catch an exception.
Possible solution: have a flag to enable pop-ups, which gets turned off when tests are starting.
Either way, needs standardizing.

ErrorController uses a string instead of a buffer.

Tests that end with Invalid (testCreateActivityInvalid) are currently failing because they expect a null object and do not get it.
Given that there is not error-checking to prevent an activity with a deadline before the start date, these tests fail when the activity/project is returned.
Once these cases are handled, these tests should pass.

No method to tell whether activity is in list of activities.
Really ugly hack in testPModel.testDeleteActivity()

Bugs:
=====
-I am able to create a project where the deadline comes before the start date:
(TestCreateProjectInvalidDates)
-I am to modify activity dates so that deadline comes before start date.
-I am able to modify an existing activity's duration to exceed the project duration.
-New project and activity dialog boxes allow to drag-and-drop dates, but modifying an activity's data requires manual entry, whose input allows incorrect dates.
-How to see/modify project's settings (description, dates, etc...)
